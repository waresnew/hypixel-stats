# HypixelStats


A Minecraft 1.8 mod that prints the stats of every player in your lobby upon joining, using the Hypixel API.

_Update: This still works with the API changes but you need to manually set [your own key](https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard) in config.json now_

_Also please note that I no longer play Minecraft, so this won't be updated anymore probably._
